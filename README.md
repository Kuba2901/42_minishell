# Minishell

This repository will contain the source code of the 42 minishell project, part of the common core.

## Tokenisation

Maybe try splitting by special (reserved) characters if they are not next to each other.

Issue with splitting by whitespace:
echo "hello world" > test
echo "hello world">test
